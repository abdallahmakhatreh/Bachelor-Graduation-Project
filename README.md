# Bachelor-Graduation-Project
A face recognition–based attendance management application developed as a Computer Science graduation project. The system automates attendance tracking by identifying registered users through facial features, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

## Demo Video

A short demonstration of the Attendance System in action — showing registration, face recognition, attendance functionality, and role‑based views for students and teachers.
